## Benchmarking

linescore-parse retrieves an URL; linescores calls it with 15 different urls. This seems like a good test case for map vs. pmap.

Rudimentary benchmarking makes pmap look a consistent order of magnitude faster than map. (I'm assuming the first map result is some sort of initialization outlier.)

```
baseball.core=> (def x (time (doall (linescores games map))))
"Elapsed time: 5441.736059 msecs"
#'baseball.core/x

baseball.core=> (def x (time (doall (linescores games pmap))))
"Elapsed time: 46.62959 msecs"
#'baseball.core/x

baseball.core=> (def x (time (doall (linescores games map))))
"Elapsed time: 320.786797 msecs"
#'baseball.core/x

baseball.core=> (def x (time (doall (linescores games pmap))))
"Elapsed time: 40.223559 msecs"
#'baseball.core/x

baseball.core=> (def x (time (doall (linescores games map))))
"Elapsed time: 225.619857 msecs"
#'baseball.core/x

baseball.core=> (def x (time (doall (linescores games pmap))))
"Elapsed time: 63.672544 msecs"
#'baseball.core/x
```

I also wanted to benchmark with [criterium](https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium), but the first time I tried to quick-bench the pmap version, my Mac crashed. criterium bug? clojure bug? jvm bug? OS X bug? I dunno. Maybe I'll poke around a bit when I have a chance, and see if I can shorten the list of suspects.
